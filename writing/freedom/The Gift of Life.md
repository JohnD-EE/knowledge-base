# The Gift of Life
"Don’t it always seem to go, you don't know what you've got ‘til it's gone." - Joni Mitchell, Big Yellow Taxi

You only really appreciate something once it is taken away. At the end of my life, perhaps I'll look back with a truer perception of it's value. I certainly hope I don't look back with regret. I would like to have a feeling of acceptance of my pending demise, or my pending release from the chains of this mortal coil - ready for whatever awaits.

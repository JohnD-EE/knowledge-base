"Taking a knee.

I wouldn't take a knee. I have no objection to others doing it, but I wouldn't. It isn't that I don't sympathise with those who feel oppressed by the cruelty of racism, I do! My wife and kids are mixed race and we have lived with the stupidity of racial abuse.

I refuse to be intimidated by a group mentality that expects me to conform. I refuse to be forced to comply for fear of being ostracised and attacked by others who would oppress me. I refuse to kneel because of their expectations.

Choosing not to comply does not indicate my disagreement with the political statement, however, I will not replace one form of oppression for another!" - Robin Horsfall

# Self Care
This chapter will be contentious. I want to play with the idea that if I'm not looking after myself - my health, my mental state, my general wellbeing, then I'm not free. If I don't exercise, don't eat well, drink too much, smoke, or indulge in drug taking which is toxic to my health, then I am increasing my probability of being burdensome to others.

Before embracing ideas of societal freedoms in the next section, I would like to think about accepting personal responsibility for our own health, or at least those health issues which are most influenced by our lifestyle choices.

I'm writing this towards the end of January 2021.  Since lockdown began in March 2020 I have put on a bit of weight - around 6 or 7 pounds.  I've exercised most days but before lockdown my exercise levels were much higher.  On weekdays, I would drive to work early to avoid the traffic, park outside of town, perhaps kayak for 4 miles on the river, before running into work.  Sometimes I would do a yoga routine or a high intensity aerobic workout. In the evenings I'd run back to my car and 2 or 3 times a week I would go to the indoor climbing centre.  I would eat healthily at work, laughed at or admired by others for my salad munching and avoidance of takeaways.  I would fast regularly in different ways - intermittent fasting or frequent (weekly) fasts of 40+ hours.

During lockdown, my routine has changed. I've been miserable and lazy. I was miserable commuting to work every day but the routine helped to keep myself accountable - attaching exercise and self-care stuff to the events of the day.




If I choose not to look after myself now, if always default to short term unhealthy indulgences, my future self will pay the price.  I am deliberately constraining the freedom, constraining the choices of my future self - I am deliberately increasing the probability that my future self will be a burden upon others, shortening my health-span, and increasing my likely dependence on other people.

# Preface

I've finally found what's so important to me. After so much soul searching, so many ups and downs, searching for that 'something' to fulfill a desire which has been eating away at me for so many years. This inner desire, common to many people during these times, has been a painful and unrequited search. I suppose you could call it a search for meaning, or purpose. Something to make sense of it all. Something tangible and worth fighting for. Some higher principle to guide my decisions and the way I relate to others.

What I have found, is that the one singular underlying idealistic concept which has driven everything I do, is freedom. The idea of 'Freedom' has had a role in every decision I've made. It beats in my heart and roams in my mind. I've felt liberated when unleashed to do my own thing, and bounded and constrained when having to fit in with restrictions conventions outside of my control.

But if freedom is so important to me, why am I writing this whilst supping my third cup of strong black coffee? Without my caffeine hit, I'd be unsettled and grouchy, and soon enduring that awful headache that anyone going cold-turkey with caffeine will attest to.

"There's too much caffeine In your bloodstream
And a lack of real spice in your life" - to quote Morrissey...

I have no special love for Morrissey, but in trying to explain the ineffable I will be delving into art and literature as I explore this central idea that a yearning for freedom has been the driving force of much of my life. Perhaps it is also the driving force of other people's lives.

# Preface

I've finally found what's so important to me. After so much soul searching, so many ups and downs, searching for that 'something' to fulfill a desire which has been eating away at me for so many years. This inner desire, common to many people during these times, has been a painful and unrequited search. I suppose you could call it a search for meaning, or purpose. Something to make sense of it all. Something tangible and worth fighting for. Some higher principle to guide my decisions and the way I relate to others.

What I have found, is that the one singular underlying idealistic concept which has driven everything I do, is freedom. The idea of 'Freedom' has had a role in every decision I've made. It beats in my heart and roams in my mind.

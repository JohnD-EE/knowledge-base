# Preface

I've finally found what's so important to me. After so much soul searching, so many ups and downs, searching for that 'something' to fulfill a desire which has been eating away at me for so many years. This inner desire, common to many people during these times, has been a painful and unrequited search. I suppose you could call it a search for meaning, or purpose. Something to make sense of it all. Something tangible and worth fighting for. Some higher principle to guide my decisions and the way I relate to others.

What I have found, is that the one singular underlying idealistic concept which has driven everything I do, is freedom. The idea of 'Freedom' has had a role in every decision I've made. It beats in my heart and roams in my mind. I've felt liberated when unleashed to do my own thing, and bounded and constrained when having to fit in with restrictions conventions outside of my control.

But if freedom is so important to me, why am I writing this whilst supping my third cup of strong black coffee? Without my caffeine hit, I'd be unsettled and grouchy, and soon enduring that awful headache that anyone going cold-turkey with caffeine will attest to.

"There's too much caffeine In your bloodstream
And a lack of real spice in your life" - to quote Morrissey...

I have no special love for Morrissey, but in trying to explain the ineffable I will be delving into art and literature as I explore this central idea that a yearning for freedom has been the driving force of much of my life. Perhaps it is also the driving force of other people's lives.

So, I have acknowledge this feeling I have, as an inner drive for a sense of freedom, yet there are many things I voluntarily do, such as slavishly drinking coffee every morning, which violate this drive.  Of course life is a series of trade-offs. I've traded my personal freedom for marriage, mortgage, children and a dependency on a monthly salary. 

I still yearn for freedom, financial freedom so that I can utilise my time for the things I find interesting and important. To be able to roam wherever my fancy takes me. To one day wake up in the mountains and the next by the sea, taking a swim at sunrise, appreciating the natural world before delving into some kind of intellectual, artistic, or physical pursuit.It has always puzzled me that so many people seem to enjoy having their freedoms constrained, or want to constrain so tightly the freedoms of others.

I'm writing these words in the UK, mid-January 2021, during the third government-imposed lockdown in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Different opinions play out on the rights and wrongs of this approach but there is no shortage of people arguing for even tighter restrictions on people's freedoms, public shaming of those who, for whatever reasons have flouted the rules, and public ridicule of those who dare to share an opinion contrary to the general consensus. An 'exclusive' in the Daily Telegraph has revealed that companies have been contracted to produce 'Health Passport' proof-of-concepts, which could be used to permit access to public spaces only to those who can prove their vaccination status or positive Covid test status. People cheer for the 'de-platforming' of people expressing views they find unpalatable, when the self-proclaimed free speech platform Parler is thrown of Apple and Google App stores and de-hosted from Amazon Web Services, and when rightly or wrongly, President Trump is canceled by Twitter. This so-called Cancel Culture has echoes of George Orwell's 'memory holes', Ray Bradbury's book-burning firemen in Fahrenheit 451, the Catholic Inquisitions, and mediaeval witch hunts. YouTube continues with it's policy of suspending its service to people who question the analysis and guidance of the World Health Authority (WHO) on the best approach to deal with Covid-19.

There are a varying opinions on the enforced lockdowns and restrictions on people's behaviours with some people outraged at the encroaching control of the state, while others are outraged that the measures have not been stringent enough. There are moral issues 

While we celebrate the silencing of contrary and controversial viewpoints, and while striving to find truth and good sense amongst the myriad of mis-truths, mis-information, and deliberate dis-information - censorship always raises the moral issue of who decides what is right and what is wrong, what is truth and what isn't - and whether we should instead be focusing on the spread of critical thinking, the development of our moral principles, and a more nuanced public discourse so that we may be better positioned to discern fact from fiction, and all of the shades of grey ourselves?

Our vitriolic support for the de-platforming of Donald Trump, Alex Jones, David Icke, Tommy Robinson, Milo Yiannopoulos and many others may feel right in the moment, and certainly the banning of those who preach hatred and deliberately incite violence, as well as other horrific acts which a certain proportion of humans take pleasure in acting out against their fellow people. But who decides what we are free to think, what we are free to say, and what we are free to listen to.  What some may see as draconian, others see as a mark of a civilised society. Some may see our governments, our heads of state or religious leaders as the best arbiters of morality, but history has shown 

We value our freedoms, and defend them...  War

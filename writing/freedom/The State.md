# The State
"Instead of governing society, the state seeks to dictate and enforce the conditions that it thinks to be 'best' for society in some generally agreed sense, stripping that society of the means to develop it's own real solutions" - Gregory Sams, The State is Out of Date, p37

Government, if it exists at all, should be there serve the public, not tell it what to do.

What we call 'reality' is an illusion we that, to a large extent, we all happen to agree upon - an internal model of sensory inputs.

Epistemic fracture.

Strong opinions loosely held.

Are we really free:
The influence of our upbringing, our cultures, the need to 'fit in' over what we think, how we think (e.g. the influence of anxiety and rumination)

How we are a filter - a prism - which refracts the world - orange tinted glasses will make snow look orange (Rupert Spira) - Consciousness as the primary substance of the universe...

Natural limitations of our freedoms:
Theory of constraints, the limitations of our human bodies (bipedalism and how it is overcome by transportation).
The limits of our consciousness and cognitive capacity

Free will vs determinism.

Restraint of the Ego, or human desire for power:

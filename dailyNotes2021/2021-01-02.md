#### Personal musings & ideas:
- Today we are enjoying a psilocybin experience.  I want to go into it with the idea that consciousness pervades everything, that consciousness may be the fundamental property of the universe. Matter arises from consciousness. Matter as we think of it only exists because there is consciousness to conceive of it in that manner. Is something a certain colour, or is it our mind which makes it so?

- It doesn't really matter, it just happens the way it needs to

## Six core moral foundations:
- [[Care-Harm]]
- [[Fairness-Cheating]]
- [[Loyalty-Betrayal]]
- [[Authority-Subversion]]
- [[Sanctity-Degradation]]
- [[Liberty-Oppression]]

## Uses of the model
- We intuitively value certain morals or ethics, our culture then constructs virtues, narratives, and institutions on top of these foundations
- Explains the culture wars

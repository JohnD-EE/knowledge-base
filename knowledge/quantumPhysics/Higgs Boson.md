- The Higgs boson produces a field that interacts with particles and gives them mass
- If the particles in the Standard models were extremely massive (E.g. if the W and Z Bosons existed then they had to be massive) then the whole theory of the model breaks down - so Peter Higgs invented another field which would imbue the other particles with mass by passing through this new Higgs cosmic energy field.
- Higgs' paper was originally rejected.
- It was important to find the Higgs particle because if you didn't find it, the standard model collapsed.

# Standard Model of Quantum Physics
#quantum-physics #particle-physics #subatomic

- The first elementary particle to be discovered was the [[Electron]] - 1897 at the Cavendish laboratory.
- In an atom we have [[Nucleus]], positively charged, surrounded by negatively charged [[Electron|Electrons]]
- It was discovered in the 1930s that inside the Nucleus are even smaller particles - [[Proton|Protons]] and [[Neutron|Neutrons]], and these make up most of the mass of an element as they are 2,000 times more massive than an electron.
- The atomic number is the number of [[Proton|Protons]] in the element - e.g. Hydrogen has one Proton, Potassium has 19.

## The Standard Model - Sub Atomic Particles

![Standard Model of physics](https://www.abc.net.au/cm/lb/7864318/data/standard-model-of-physics-data.jpg)

#### 1st Generation Particles
- There are two types of particles, called [[Fermions]], that make up matter: [[Quark|Quarks]] and [[Lepton|Leptons]]
- In the 1960s it was discovered that Protons and Neutrons are actually made of small things, called [[Quark]]
- Neutron has one up Quark and two down quarks
- Proton is made of two up Quarks and one down Quark
- Everything at the fundamental level is made of up quarks, down quarks and electrons
- The model also includes [[Neutrino|Neutrinos]], invisible, hard to detect, produced by the sun, trillions pass through us every second. They can go all the way through the earth without interacting with any matter at all.
- The 1st generation Neutrino is the [[Electron Neutrino]]

#### 2nd Generation Particles
- Very rare. Can be made in high energy collisions (e.g. at the [[Large Hadron Collider]].
- Heavier cousins of the 1st generation particles
- The electron has a heavy cousin called the [[Muon]], which is 200 times more massive than the electron. Muons very quickly decay into an electron and some neutrinos.
- The 2nd generation particle to the [[Up Quark]] is the [[Charm Quark]]
- The 2nd generation particle to the [[Down Quark]] is the [[Strange Quark]]
- The 2nd generation neutrino is the [[Muon Neutrino]]

#### 3rd Generation Particles
- These are even heavier
- These are [[Antimatter]] particles
- The anti-matter electron is the [[Tau]]
- The anti-matter Up Quark is the [[Top Quark]]
- The anti-matter Down Quark is the [[Bottom Quark]]
- The anti-matter Neutrino is the [[Tau Neutrino]]

#### Force Particles
- There are 3 Fundamental forces in this model (e.g. doesn't include [[Gravity]].
- [[Electromagnetism]] which binds atoms together. This is mediated by the [[Photon]], the light particle.
- [[Gluon]], the the mediator of the [[Strong Nuclear Force]] which binds quarks together inside the Nucleus, gluing Protons and Neutrons together
- [[W and Z Bosons]] - Together mediate the [[Weak Nuclear Force]] - which causes particles to decay

#### More
- The [[Higgs Boson]] produces a field that interacts with particles and gives them mass

Actually best to see these all as [[Fields]] rather than Particles. Every one of these particles has an associated fields. The particles are tiny ripples moving though these fields as localised disturbances.

## What remains unknown
- We don't know if gravitons exist (Our accelerators may never have enough energy to find particles that will explain gravity)
- Why are Quarks and Leptons different?
- The model doesn't explain [[Dark Matter]] or [[Dark Energy]]
- Strangely, The Model predicts that matter and [[Antimatter]] should have been produced in equal amounts at the birth of the universe and annihilated immediately thereafter, leaving one enormous sea of light.
- The model predicts that [[Neutrino|Neutrinos]] should have zero mass, but they do have very very tiny mass

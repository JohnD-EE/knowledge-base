##### Contextual
- Force is also known as Fundamental Interaction - can not be reduced to more basic interactions
- Force is fundamental to existence - without Force, particles would float around everywhere, we couldn't exist.
- At the quantum scale, forces are created by exchanging particles (Gluons, Photons, W and Z Bosons) - this are the mediators. It is speculated that there is a graviton particle for gravity.

#### There are 4 Fundamental Interactions
| Interaction | Theory | Mediators  | Relative Strength | Range (m) |
| ------------- |:-------------:| :-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| **[[Gravity]]**     | [[General Theory of Relativity]]  | [[Gravitons]] (hypothetical) | 1 (very weak)  | $\infty$ |
|  **[[Electromagnetism]]**     | [[Quantum Electrodynamics]]  | [[Photon]]   |  $10^{36}$  | $\infty$  |
|  **[[Weak Nuclear Force]]**     | [[Electroweak Theory]]  | [[W and Z Bosons]] |  $10^{25}$  | $10^{-18}$  |
|  **[[Strong Nuclear Force]]**     | [[Quantum Chronodynamics]]  | [[Gluon]]  |   $10^{38}$ |  $10^{-15}$ |

##### Notes
- Gravity is not yet explained by quantum physics, while the other 3 forces are well understood.
- Gravity and Electromagnetism have a very long range - e.g. inter-galactical influences - Infinity
- The Weak and Strong Forces have a very limited range (distances smaller than the size of a [[Proton]])

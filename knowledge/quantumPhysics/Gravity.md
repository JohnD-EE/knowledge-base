- Gravity is a very weak force
- The attraction between two objects that have mass or energy
- Not currently explained by quantum physics
- Einstein's [[General Theory of Relativity]] suggests that gravity is not a force but a consequence of objects bending space-time
- Gravity has almost no effect relative to the other fundamental forces

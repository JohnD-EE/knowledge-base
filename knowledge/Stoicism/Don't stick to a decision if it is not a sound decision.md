# Don't stick to a decision if it is not a sound decision

#### Epictetus, Discourses Book II, 15, "To people who cling hard to certain of their decisions"

[[@Epictetus]]

- “Some people suppose that the virtue of resolution… entails that our decisions should all be honoured to the extent of never backing off from one an inch. No -the decision first must be well founded.” - #quote 
- "If you are taking pride in having the energy of a lunatic... this is not strength, but a kind of infirmity"
- "If it was a reckless decision, it should be open to change."
- "A fool cannot be convinced or even compelled to renounce his folly"

#### Thoughts
- Is #resolution and #virtue or an illness? #question
- We admire the #unconflicted person, who with a steadfast determination will persist with their resolution. But isn't the more flexible, more agile person. willing to change and adapt more admirable?
- Resolution can be a hindrance to truth
- If it's a business or political decision, always look at the reversibility of the decision. If easily reversible, then make the decision quickly, if it is hard to undo, then take your time.
- Our life is full of decisions we call it a virtue to stick to - career decisions, lifetime partner decisions, embarking on destructive habits, projecting our persona a certain way, stating a preference for this or that belief - we persist down these paths until the pain of sticking to our decision is greater than the great pain of changing our mind.
- It is not a noble virtue to resolutely stick to ill-considered decisions.

#### Overcoming the need to stick to a decision
- Publicly state a random opinion, and deliberately change your mind.
- Trace your current behaviours back to an initial decision
- Regularly evaluate your decisions, the assumptions, the context, your mood, the information you had at hand.  Has anything changed? is it still a decision worth sticking to? Is our position still valid? #question
- Ask people - when was the last time you changed your mind on something important or controversial? #question 

#### Applications:
- Politicians could learn from this. They stick doggedly to decisions, even when the decision is shown to be flawed. I suppose this is the life of a modern politician, they succeed politically by 'thinking' in line with the party, not rocking the boat, being seen as strong and decisive, not flaky.
- Bad political decisions can take generations to undo

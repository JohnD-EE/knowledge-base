# Systems Thinking
Definition: "Systems thinking is zooming out to see the world holistically as a web of foundational interconnections unfolding over time." - Rhys Lindmark

Instead of seeing the world atomistically, we zoom out and look at the interconnections.  Not reductionist machine like thinking. Use biology as a metaphor - organic.

Seeing the world as it truly is.

Reality is a series of feedback loops.

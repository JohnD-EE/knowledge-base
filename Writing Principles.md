# Writing Principles

### Practice Epistemic Thinking


### First Principles
Boil everything down to first principles - whether looking at intangibles such as morality or value judgements, or more tangible, concrete things, try to look for first principles, function over form. As per the physicist's approach described by Elon Musk.

Explore the fundamentals of an idea. Ask why and how. What are the indivisible foundations that we know are true, upon which we can layer more complex ideas?  
Musk: Boil things down to their fundamental Truths and reason up from there. Most of our life we reason by analogy, copying what other people do with slight variations.

Aristotle would divide everything down to subcategories, until the subcategories could be divided no further.

If you understand the first principles of an issue or a concept, it's easier to communicate the idea to others.  It's easier to optimise or innovate from first principles.

1. Identify and define your current assumptions
2. Break down the problem into its fundamental principles
3. Create new solutions

But isn't this atomistic / reductionist / materialist thinking when we want to be thinking in systems?

### Don't Seek Answers
Instead of suggesting answers and solutions, seek to understand and explain the problems really well.  Don't let the lack of an obvious answer preclude you from exploring a difficult subject.
